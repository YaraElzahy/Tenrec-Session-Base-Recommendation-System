This model demonstrated superior performance compared to other models, including GRU4Rec, BERT4Rec, and SASRec, on two distinct datasets representing users with age 3 and users with age 0. The comparison revealed that NextItNet consistently achieved higher NDCG@20 values, indicating its effectiveness in capturing sequential patterns and recommending relevant items to users.\n",

However, it is worth noting that the validation NDCG@20 score remained relatively stable throughout the training epochs, hovering around 0.0080. This observation suggests that the model might have reached a point of convergence and might not be improving significantly with additional training epochs.\n",

Additionally, the model's architecture is more lightweight compared to other candidate models, making it computationally efficient.\n",
